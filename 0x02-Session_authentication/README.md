# The ALX Project: Session Authentication
------------
__Session Authentication__ focuses on implementing secure user authentication 
using sessions. In web applications, authentication is a 
fundamental aspect of ensuring that users are who they claim to be. 
__Session authentication__ provides a way to maintain user identity across 
multiple requests during a user's visit to a website or web application.

In this project, the goal is to implement __session-based authentication__ 
to enhance the security and user experience of web applications; For instance, 
through various authentication methods and techniques, session management, 
and secure user login and logout functionalities.
